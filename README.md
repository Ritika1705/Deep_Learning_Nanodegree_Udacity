# Deep_Learning_Nanodegree_Udacity

This project contains all the files that were required to complete my deep learning nanodegree course from udacity.
- The first project is building our own CNN model and predicting the bikesharing prices.


- The next project is dog-breed classifier model which can predict dog breeds by looking at their pictures.
